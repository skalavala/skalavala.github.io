Looking for a way to restart and upgrade Home Assistant using just the GUI? Follow two simple steps, and you are all set!

## Restart and Upgrade HomeAssistant over Web GUI

<p>Follow the two simple steps to make your HASS Restart and even Upgrade to newer version (if available) without using command line interface (CLI). Please note that if there are any existing configuration errors, your upgrade might not be successful. Also, If the upgrade has any breaking changes, your Home Assistant might failed to load some or all. Please read the breaking changes section before upgrading.</p>

Also, if you have not used `hassctl`, it is HIGHLY recommended that you take a minute and set it up. You can find the `hassctl` <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dale3h/hassctl">here</a>.

### Step 1: Add the following to the sudoers by running the following command 

PLEASE NOTE THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO EDIT SUDOERS FILE USING YOUR FAVORITE EDITOR. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BOOT! USE THE RIGHT COMMAND, AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO MAKE ANY STUPID MISTAKES. DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING BEFORE SAVING.

```
sudo visudo
```

Enter the following contents to your SUDOERS file. You might already have most of the content, in that case, just add the last 3 lines.

```
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of
# directly modifying this file.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#
Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"

# Host alias specification

# User alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives:

#includedir /etc/sudoers.d

# Allow homeassistant to use hassctl
homeassistant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl
homeassistant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/journalctl
```

### Step 2: Add the following to a package/file and restart your HASS

```
homeassistant:
  customize:
  
    script.update_hass:
      friendly_name: Update Home Assistant
      icon: mdi:home-assistant

    script.restart_hass:
      friendly_name: Restart Home Assistant
      icon: mdi:home-assistant

script:
  update_hass:
    sequence:
      - service: shell_command.update_hass
  restart_hass:
    sequence:
      - service: shell_command.restart_hass

shell_command:
  restart_hass: >-
    hassctl restart

  update_hass: >-
    hassctl update-hass && hassctl config && hassctl restart
```
