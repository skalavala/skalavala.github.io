Want to make your own Multi-Room Audio System that works entirely on your WiFi network using nothing but Raspberry Pi's and some cheap speakers?

Don't be fooled by the above picture. You will not be making that one ;)  But you get the idea. Each room will have a Raspberry Pi connected to a portable speaker. Each of those Raspberry Pi runs `snapcast client` that is connected to a `snapcast server` over the WiFi, and plays the media as it receives.
