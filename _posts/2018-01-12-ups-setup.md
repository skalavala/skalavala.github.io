Got a new battery backup, and want to set it up and automate it?


## Setting up UPS on Ubuntu

<p>The package apcupsd provides a daemon which will monitor your APC UPS, and shutdown the system when power is no longer being supplied to the UPS.</p>

### Prerequisites

<p>An APC UPS. The apcupsd daemon works with most APC Smart-UPS models, as well as most simple signaling models, such as Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office.</p>

## Installation

### When using systemd

<p>This example assumes you are using a APC Smart-UPS 750 via USB.</p>

<p>First, install the apcupsd package via a terminal: </p>

```
sudo apt-get -y install apcupsd
```

Next, backup the original configuration files:
```
sudo cp /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf.bak
```

Next, edit the configuration files: 
```
sudo nano /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
```

```
UPSNAME smartups750
UPSCABLE usb
UPSTYPE usb
DEVICE 
POLLTIME 60
```

```
sudo cp /etc/default/apcupsd /etc/default/apcupsd.bak
```

```
sudo nano /etc/default/apcupsd
```

```
ISCONFIGURED=yes
```

 <p>Now one may check the status of the UPS via a terminal: </p>
 ```
 apcaccess status
 ```

 When you run the command, you will see something like this...

```

```

In order to run `apctest`, one must first stop apcupsd via a terminal: 

```
sudo systemctl stop apcupsd
```

Otherwise, one may see the following error: 
```
sudo apctest
2015-09-26 18:57:38 apctest 3.14.12 (29 March 2014) debian
Checking configuration ...
sharenet.type = Network & ShareUPS Disabled
cable.type = USB Cable
mode.type = USB UPS Driver
apctest FATAL ERROR in apctest.c at line 335
Unable to create UPS lock file.
  If apcupsd or apctest is already running,
  please stop it and run this program again.
apctest error termination completed
```

Then execute the collowing command: 
```
sudo apctest
```

That will show the following output:
```
