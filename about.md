I am a man of many hobbies. Love to tinker with stuff, and live to learn. I do many things in my free time, and this is one of those activities. I got into home automation a few years ago, and never stopped since then. The craziness only grew bigger and the amount of stuff that I learned over the period of time from all the talented individuals in the open source community is simply amazing!
