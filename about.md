I Love to tinker with stuff, and live to learn. I do "many things" in my free time, and Home Automation is one of those "things". I started working on home automation a few years ago, and I never stopped since then. The craziness only grew bigger, and the amount of stuff that I learned over the period of time from all the talented individuals in the open source community is simply mind blowing!

I am not a full-time blogger, and I don't get much time to blog just about evrything that most of the bloggers do. So, expect infrequent updates on this site. If you have any specific topics or areas you would like me to get deeper, please feel free to leave a message.

A big shout out to all the creative and amazing folks out there!
