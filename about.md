I Love to tinker with stuff, and live to learn. I do "many things" in my free time, and this is one of those "things". You will find mostly  home automation stuff on my github repo. I got into home automation a few years ago, and never stopped since then. The craziness only grew bigger and the amount of stuff that I learned over the period of time from all the talented individuals in the open source community is simply mind blowing!

A big shout out to all the creative and amazing folks out there!
