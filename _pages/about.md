Welcome to <strong>AI Shenanigans by Suresh</strong>.

Iâ€™m Suresh Kalavala, a 27-year IT veteran whoâ€™s spent decades architecting large-scale systems, securing systems/clouds, wrangling infrastructure, and occasionally wondering why some programs only work on my machine. My day job revolves around making tech work at scale. My night job? Tinkering with rack-mounted servers at home, modding drones, fiddling with 3d printers, building IoT contraptions that confuse my neighbors, and pushing the limits of 3D printers, electronics, and anything that bleeps, blinks, or boots.

This blog is my digital playground. Whenever I get free time (which is extremely rare), I use this space to share how information technology and AI is reshaping the enterprise landscape.

Lately I have been exploring AI through agentic architectures. Expect some new posts on building all kinds of AI applications, LLMs, private stacks, scaling strategies, architectural patterns, and the ever-evolving circus of AI tooling. I am a big fan of LangChain, LangGraph, LLamaIndex, Huggingface models, Ollama, basically anything that is free, that I can run on my Home Lab locally.

Whether youâ€™re here to learn, laugh, or lurk while pretending to understand what the heck I actually do, youâ€™re welcome ðŸ˜Š

Come for the random AI topics. Stay for the shenanigans.
